Holy Bible

                      first he sent Your Majesty's Royal Person to rule and
   reign over us. For whereas it was the expectation of many, who wished
   not well unto our Sion, that, upon the setting of that bright
   Occindental Star, Queen Elizabeth, of most happy memory, some thick and
   palpable clouds of darkness would so have overshadowed this land, that
   men should have been in doubt which way they were to walk, and that it
   should hardly be known who was to direct the unsettled State; the
   appearance of Your Majest  among us, which is that inestimable treasure which excelleth all the
   riches of the earth; because the fruit thereof extendeth itself, not
   only to the time spent in this transitory world, but directeth and
   disposeth men unto that eternal happiness which is above in heaven.

   Then not to suffer this fall to the ground, but rather to take it up,
   and to continue it in that state wherein the famous Predecessor of Your
   Highness did leave it; nay, to go forward with the confidence and
   resolut taketh strength, when they observe that the
   zeal of Your Majesty toward the house of God doth not slack or go
   backward, but is more and more kindled, manifesting itself abroad in
   the farthest parts of Christendom, by writing in defence of the truth,
   (which hath given such a blow unto that Man of Sin as will not be
   healed,) and every day at home, by religious and learned discourse, by
   frequenting the house of God, by hearing the Word preached, by
   cherishing the teachers thereof, by caritogether with comparing of the labours, both in our own and
   other foreign languages, of many worthy men who went before us, there
   should be one more exact translation of the Holy Scriptures into the
   English tongue; Your Majesty did never desist to urge and to excite
   those to whom it was commended, that the Work might be hastened, and
   that the business might be expedited in so decent a manner, as a matter
   of such importance might justly require.

   And now at last, by the mercy of God, and patronage from so learned and
   judicious a Prince as Your Highness is; whose allowance and acceptance
   of our labours shall more honour and encourage us, than all the
   calumniations and hard interpretations of other men shall dismay us. So
   that if, on the one side, we shall be traduced by Popish persons at
   home or abroad, who therefore will malign us, because we are poor
   instruments to make God's holy truth to be yet more and more known unto
   the people, whom they desire still to keep in io
   honest and Christian endeavours against bitter censures and
   uncharitable imputations.

   The Lord of heaven and earth bless Your Majesty with many and happy
   days, that, as his heavenly hand hath enriched Your Highness with many
   singular and extraordinary graces, so You may be the wonder of the
   world in this latter age for happiness and true felicity, to the honour
   of that great God, and the good of his Church, through Jesus Christ our
   Lord and only Saviour.

   left for cavil to enter, (and cavil, if it do not find a hole, will
   make one) it is sure to be misconstrued, and in danger to be condemned.
   This will easily be granted by as many as know story, or have any
   experience. For, was there ever any-projected, that savoured any way of
   newness or renewing, but the same endured many a storm of gainsaying,
   or opposition? A man would think that Civility, wholesome Laws,
   learning and eloquence, Synods, and Church-maintenance, (that we speak
   we have attained unto ourselves; Briefly, by the fourth being
   brought together to a parley face to face, we sooner compose our
   differences than by writings which are endless; And lastly, that the
   Church be sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and
   conscience, that those mothers are holden to be less cruel, that kill
   their children as soon as they are born, than those nursing fathers and
   mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw from them who hang upon
   their breastnone other fault,
   but for seeking to reduce their Countrymen to god order and discipline;
   and that in some Commonwealths [e.g. Locri] it was made a capital
   crime, once to motion the making of a new Law for the abrogating of an
   old, though the same were most pernicious; And that certain [Cato the
   elder], which would be counted pillars of the State, and patterns of
   Virtue and Prudence, could not be brought for a long time to give way
   to good Letters and refined speech, but bare themselvest is not
   unknown what a fiction or fable (so it is esteemed, and for no better
   by the reporter himself [Nauclerus], though superstitious) was devised;
   Namely, that at such a time as the professors and teachers of
   Christianity in the Church of Rome, then a true Church, were liberally
   endowed, a voice forsooth was heard from heaven, saying: Now is poison
   poured down into the Church, etc. Thus not only as oft as we speak, as
   one saith, but also as oft as we do anything of note or consequenmy, but at
   the face; And as the King of Syria commanded his chief Captains to
   "fight neither with small nor great, save only against the King of
   Israel:" [1 Kings 22:31] so it is too true, that Envy striketh most
   spitefully at the fairest, and at the chiefest. David was a worthy
   Prince, and no man to be compared to him for his first deeds, and yet
   for as worthy as act as ever he did (even for bringing back the Ark of
   God in solemnity) he was scorned and scoffed at by his own wife [2 Samarged them with some levies, and troubled them with some carriages;
   Hereupon they raise up a tragedy, and wish in their heart the Temple
   had never been built. So hard a thing it is to please all, even when we
   please God best, and do seek to approve ourselves to every ones
   conscience.

   If we will descend to later times, we shall find many the like examples
   of such kind, or rather unkind acceptance. The first Roman Emperor [C.
   Caesar. Plutarch] did never do a more pleasing deed to the leafor
   the Church, as he did, got for his labour the name Pupillus, as who
   would say, a wasteful Prince, that had need of a Guardian or overseer
   [Aurel. Victor]. So the best Christened Emperor [Theodosius], for the
   love that he bare unto peace, thereby to enrich both himself and his
   subjects, and because he did not see war but find it, was judged to be
   no man at arms [Zosimus], (though indeed he excelled in feats of
   chivalry, and showed so much when he was provoked) and condemned for
   gir times, even, Cum bene facerent, male
   audire, For their good deeds to be evil spoken of. Neither is there any
   likelihood, that envy and malignity died, and were buried with the
   ancient. No, no, the reproof of Moses taketh hold of most ages; "You
   are risen up in your fathers' stead, and increase of sinful men." [Num
   32:14] "What is that that hath been done? that which shall be done; and
   there is no new thing under the Sun," saith the wiseman: [Ecc 1:9] and
   S. Stephen, "As your fathers dlic (especially if it pertain to Religion, and to
   the opening and clearing of the word of God) the same setteth himself
   upon a stage to be gloated upon by every evil eye, yea, he casteth
   himself headlong upon pikes, to be gored by every sharp tongue. For he
   that medleth with men's Religion in any part, medleth with their
   custom, nay, with their freehold; and though they find no content in
   that which they have, yet they cannot abide to hear of altering.
   Notwithstanding his Royal heart waunto them, to have care of Religion, yea,
   it doth specially belong unto them, to have care of Religion, yea, to
   know it aright, yea, to profess it zealously, yea to promote it to the
   uttermost of their power. This is their glory before all nations which
   mean well, and this will bring unto them a far most excellent weight of
   glory in the day of the Lord Jesus. For the Scripture saith not in
   vain, "Them that honor me, I will honor," [1 Sam 2:30] neither was it a
   vain word that Eusebius de7:11 and 8:28,29. They are reproved that were unskillful in them, or
   slow to believe them. Matt 22:29. Luke 24:25. They can make us wise
   unto salvation. 2 Tim 3:15. If we be ignorant, they will instruct us;
   if out of the way, they will bring us home; if out of order, they will
   reform us; if in heaviness, comfort us; if dull, quicken us; if cold,
   inflame us. Tolle, lege; Tolle, lege, Take up and read, take up and
   read the Scriptures [S. August. confess. lib 8 cap 12], (for unto them
   was "Ama scripturas, et amabit te sapientia etc." [S. Jerome. ad Demetriad]
   Love the Scriptures, and wisdom will love thee. And S. Cyril against
   Julian; "Even boys that are bred up in the Scriptures, become most
   religious, etc. [S. Cyril. 7 contra Iulianum] But what mention we three
   or four uses of the Scripture, whereas whatsoever is to be believed or
   practiced, or hoped for, is contained in them? or three or four
   sentences of the Fathers, since whosoever is worthy the name of a
   Father, frsaith he, "that it is not lawful (or possible) to
   learn (anything) of God or of right piety, save only out of the
   Prophets, who teach us by divine inspiration." So Saint Basil after
   Tertullian, "It is a manifest falling way from the Faith, and a fault
   of presumption, either to reject any of those things that are written,
   or to bring in (upon the head of them) any of those things that are not
   written. We omit to cite to the same effect, S. Cyril B. of Jerusalem
   in his 4::Cataches., Saintd, honey in a pot, and oil], how
   many sweet and goodly things it had hanging on it; of the Philosopher's
   stone, that it turned copper into gold; of Cornucopia, that it had all
   things necessary for food in it, of Panaces the herb, that it was good
   for diseases, of Catholicon the drug, that it is instead of all purges;
   of Vulcan's armor, that it was an armor of proof against all thrusts,
   and all blows, etc. Well, that which they falsely or vainly attributed
   to these things for bodily god,al's meat or two, but as it were a
   shower of heavenly bread sufficient for a whole host, be it never so
   great; and as it were a whole cellar full of oil vessels; whereby all
   our necessities may be provided for, and our debts discharged. In a
   word, it is a Panary of wholesome food, against fenowed traditions; a
   Physician's shop (Saint Basil called it) [S. Basil in Psal. primum.] of
   preservatives against poisoned heresies; a Pandect of profitable laws,
   against rebellious spirits; a treasu, God's oracles, the word of truth,
   the word of salvation, etc.; the effects, light of understanding,
   stableness of persuasion, repentance from dead works, newness of life,
   holiness, peace, joy in the holy Ghost; lastly, the end and reward of
   the study thereof, fellowship with the Saints, participation of the
   heavenly nature, fruition of an inheritance immortal, undefiled, and
   that never shall fade away: Happy is the man that delighted in the
   Scripture, and thrice happy that meditateth to confess, that all of us in those tongues which
   we do not understand, are plainly deaf; we may turn the deaf ear unto
   them. The Scythian counted the Athenian, whom he did not understand,
   barbarous; [Clem. Alex. 1 Strom.] so the Roman did the Syrian, and the
   Jew (even S. Jerome himself called the Hebrew tongue barbarous, belike
   because it was strange to so many) [S. Jerome. Damaso.] so the Emperor
   of Constantinople [Michael, Theophili fil.] calleth the Latin tongue,
   barbarous, though Paketh the shell, that we may eat the
   kernel; that putteth aside the curtain, that we may look into the most
   Holy place; that removeth the cover of the well, that we may come by
   the water, even as Jacob rolled away the stone from the mouth of the
   well, by which means the flocks of Laban were watered [Gen 29:10].
   Indeed without translation into the vulgar tongue, the unlearned are
   but like children at Jacob's well (which is deep) [John 4:11] without a
   bucket or something to draw with; or e all of them the language of Canaan, that is,
   Hebrew, one and the same original in Hebrew was sufficient. [S. August.
   lib 12 contra Faust c32] But, when the fulness of time drew near, that
   the Sun of righteousness, the Son of God should come into the world,
   whom God ordained to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood,
   not of the Jew only, but also of the Greek, yea, of all them that were
   scattered abroad; then lo, it pleased the Lord to stir up the spirit of
   a Greek Prince (Greervants, ready scribes, to
   copy them out, and so they were dispersed and made common. Again, the
   Greek tongue was well known and made familiar to most inhabitants in
   Asia, by reason of the conquest that there the Grecians had made, as
   also by the Colonies, which thither they had sent. For the same causes
   also it was well understood in many places of Europe, yea, and of
   Africa too. Therefore the word of God being set forth in Greek,
   becometh hereby like a candle set upon a candlestick, whficient for
   this work as the Apostles or Apostolic men? Yet it seemed good to the
   holy Ghost and to them, to take that which they found, (the same being
   for the greatest part true and sufficient) rather than making a new, in
   that new world and green age of the Church, to expose themselves to
   many exceptions and cavillations, as though they made a Translations to
   serve their own turn, and therefore bearing a witness to themselves,
   their witness not to be regarded. This may be supposed to worthily and to great purpose compiled together by Origen. Howbeit the
   Edition of the Seventy went away with the credit, and therefore not
   only was placed in the midst by Origen (for the worth and excellency
   thereof above the rest, as Epiphanius gathered) but also was used by
   the Greek fathers for the ground and foundation of their Commentaries.
   Yea, Epiphanius above named doeth attribute so much unto it, that he
   holdeth the Authors thereof not only for Interpreters, but also for
   Prophet.] that the Seventy were Interpreters, they were
   not Prophets; they did many things well, as learned men; but yet as men
   they stumbled and fell, one while through oversight, another while
   through ignorance, yea, sometimes they may be noted to add to the
   Original, and sometimes to take from it; which made the Apostles to
   leave them many times, when they left the Hebrew, and to deliver the
   sense thereof according to the truth of the word, as the spirit gave
   them utterance. This may suff
